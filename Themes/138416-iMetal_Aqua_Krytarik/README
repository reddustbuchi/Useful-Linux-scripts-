Installation
============

Theme:
------

- place the themes' directory into "/usr/share/themes" or "~/.themes"
- if you want to use your own panel background or if you have items at your panels which don't follow the panel-bg,
outcomment the "bq_pixmap" lines in "gtk-2.0/panel.rc" and choose the panel-bg via the properties dialogs of your panels


Icons (to fit the dark panels):
-----------------------------

- place the icon themes' directory into "/usr/share/icons" or "~/.icons"
- open the text editor
- browse to the icon themes' directory
- open the file "index.theme"
- replace the first entry in the line of "Inherits=" with the name of your favorite icon themes' directory ("Snow sabre" is mine)
- save it


Fix for some Thunderbird buttons:
---------------------------------

- place the included userChrome.css into the "chrome" directory of your Thunderbird profile or add its content to yours
