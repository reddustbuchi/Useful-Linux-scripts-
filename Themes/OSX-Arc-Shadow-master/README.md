### Manual Installation

How To Install:

1. Download

2. Extract to /usr/share/themes
or ~/.themes (create it (in your home folder) if necessary);

3. Change via distribution specific tweak tool.


**Note:** If your distribution doesn't ship separate development packages you just need GTK 3 instead of the `-dev` packages.

For the theme to function properly, install the following
* Gnome Shell, GTK 3.14 - 3.22
* The `gnome-themes-standard` package
* The murrine engine. This has different names depending on your distro.
  * `gtk-engine-murrine` (Arch Linux)
  * `gtk2-engines-murrine` (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
  * `gtk-murrine-engine` (Fedora)
  * `gtk2-engine-murrine` (openSUSE)
  * `gtk-engines-murrine` (Gentoo)


After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `OSX-Arc-White`, `OSX-Arc-Darker` or `OSX-Arc-Shadow` as Window/GTK+ theme and `OSX-Arc-White`, `OSX-Arc-Darker` or `OSX-Arc-Shadow` as Gnome Shell/Cinnamon theme.

## Uninstall

Run

    sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/{OSX-Arc-White,OSX-Arc-Darker,OSX-Arc-Shadow}

## Troubleshooting

If you have Ubuntu with a newer GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) you have to install the theme manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default
