#  Tenebrific 0.40
# 	Dave Kaufman
# ---------
#  A gtk2 theme inspired by visual elements of other GUIs.
#  Heavily inspired by the work of many other themers, including (but not
#  limited to)
#    - roberTO
#    - Grand Masta
# 
#    The Documentation for this theme is far from finished! Please feel free to 
#  modify this theme and release it into the wild, but make sure you leave a
#  comment like this saying who else has worked on it and who (if anyone)
#  inspired you. 
# 
#    Cleaning up the documentation is encouraged!

# The following is the default style. It contains general settings for the theme that
# should apply to all widgets that aren't explicitly defined elsewhere. At the very end
# of the file we apply this style to the class GtkWidget. If the gtkrc file contains more
# than one rule for how to draw a widget the one that occurs first in the file is used. By
# applying this style to the GtkWidget class last we're telling gtk to use these settings
# for anything that hasn't been defined yet.
