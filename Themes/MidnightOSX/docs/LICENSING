The licensing is spelled out quite clearly in the file ORIGINAL-README, however I've included this file to make it emminently clear:

Do whatever you want with this theme, as long as you leave the file ORIGINAL-README alone whenever you redistribute it.  While I would certainly enjoy receiving a mention, I won't even mandate that.  As long as you keep credit for the original author (m5brane), that's enough to satisfy me (and him).
