v 0.40  Lots of fixes to the GTK2 Theme.
          - removed extraneous entry style definition, which fixed a bug where highlighted text was indistinguishable from normal text
          - cleaned up the button look to make it more consistent
          - reversed the scrollbar and scrollbar_prelight pixmaps
          - darkened active tab and progressbar pixmaps
        New Metacity Pixmaps
          - new, darker, smoother metacity pixmaps, which better match the gtk2 theme
          - metacity theme from 0.30.1 is still available in the tarball, labelled as such.
