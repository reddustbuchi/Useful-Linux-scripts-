 Up -- Debian/Ubuntu Update Tool (Version 1.2)  -help

 Up is a tool that automates the update procedure for Debian and Ubuntu based
 Linux systems.

 Press "q" to exit this Help page.

 Commands:
    up = full system update.
    
    Running "up" with no options will update the apt cache and then perform a
    full distribution update automatically.

    up --remove = full system update with orphaned packages removed.
    up --clean = full system update with full cleanup.

    Adding the "--clean" option will invoke the apt commands to search for and
    remove locally cached packages that are no longer in the repositories and
    remove orphaned packages that are no longer needed by programs. 

    The "--remove" option only removes orphaned packages, leaving the apt cache
    alone. 

    up --help = shows this help page.
