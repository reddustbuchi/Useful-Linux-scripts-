# up-debian_ubuntu_update_tool


1. Description:

 Up is a tool that automates the update procedure for Debian and Ubuntu based
 Linux systems.

2. Installation:

 Unzip the "up" bash script from the zip archive and move it to either
 /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. You can either do this from a command line or simply
 drag the file out of Archive Manager to wherever you'd like it to go.

 Note: scripts that are run from the ~/bin directory cannot be prefixed with
 'sudo' as the system will fail to find them. Those who intend to run up from
 a script for cron, anacron or systemd timers should place it in /usr/local/bin
 This is also the best practice if there are more than one administrator
 accounts on the machine.

 Up -- Debian/Ubuntu Update Tool (Version 1.2)  -help

 Up is a tool that automates the update procedure for Debian and Ubuntu based
 Linux systems.

 Press "q" to exit this Help page.

 Commands:
    up = full system update.
    
    Running "up" with no options will update the apt cache and then perform a
    full distribution update automatically.

    up --remove = full system update with orphaned packages removed.
    up --clean = full system update with full cleanup.

    Adding the "--clean" option will invoke the apt commands to search for and
    remove locally cached packages that are no longer in the repositories and
    remove orphaned packages that are no longer needed by programs. 

    The "--remove" option only removes orphaned packages, leaving the apt cache
    alone. 

    up --help = shows this help page.
